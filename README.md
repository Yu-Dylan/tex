# TeX Files
This is a repository for TeX style files and example documents. This code is used for two (main) reasons:
- to make syncing style files with Overleaf easier[^fn1], and
- to help those interested in making style files of their own (or using mine).

I recommend using dylanadi, since a) it is the most versatile and b) I think it looks the best.

# Description of style files
## dylanadi
My main style file. I use it for basically everything, and it looks pretty.
## plain
Style file for taking notes. As the name suggests, there's not much going on design-wise.
## dylan
My first style file, based of [lindrew.sty](http://www.mit.edu/~lindrew/notes.html). I no longer use it.
## primeri.sty
An early version of dylanadi.sty that I used to create the formatting of the Primeri camp handouts.
## dylanbook
Not really mine; I just made some changes to an existing style file I've now forgotten the name of and I don't think I've ever used it (it works though!).
## von
Used for LaTeX integration with [VON](https://github.com/vEnhance/von). It's not the same as Evan's and is really only for personal use.

[^fn1]: This is no longer a reason; I compile locally now!
